# Iran AQI IoT ML Pipeline

This project builds an end-to-end, IoT-style data pipeline for **air quality (AQI)** in major Iranian cities (e.g., Tehran, Isfahan, Mashhad, Ahvaz).  
The goal is to use **real air quality data** to:

- Collect and preprocess sensor-like AQI and weather data
- Perform exploratory data analysis and visualizations
- Train machine learning models for AQI forecasting
- Export models to **ONNX** for deployment
- Organize the code in a **modular, object-oriented (OOP)** structure with proper error handling

The project is designed as a realistic, production-inspired pipeline that connects **IoT concepts**, **time-series ML**, and **data visualization**.
